<p> <b> <font color="black"> <font size="5"> <center> The favourite drinks that I like are mango juice, cocktail
juice, iced tea and lychee juice. Mostly, I like juice rather than the bicarbonate drinks because bicarbonate 
drinks contain more sugars. Additionally, drinking my favourite drinks give me a refreshing taste because it
can quench the thirst especially in the hot weather and I usually order these drinks when eating at the restaurant.
Moreover, I like these kind of drinks because of it's colour that attract my attention to drink such as mango and 
iced tea that have a yellow or orange colour.
