<p> <center> <font color="navy"> <font size="5"> I have some media social accounts such as Facebook,
Instagram and Tiktok. I created Facebook and Instagram accounts since secondary school and I active 
in using these social media platforms to read about latest updates, news and share picture or video to my friends 
or followers. Most of my followers are my friends in primary school, secondary school, university's friends,
cousins, family and my other online friends. Besides, I rarely post anything on my social media
unless it is about contents that I found interesting that caught my interests. Plus, I also post about
important contents because I did not want to share the false information to others as I will check the truth 
behind the facts first before I post something on social media platforms. Check my social media account here:  </font> </p>
