<p> <b> <font color="black"> <font size="5"> <center> There are many delicious foods in this world. It includes traditional foods,
western foods, fast foods, dessert and many more. The foods have various taste such as sweet, spicy and sour. For my favourite 
foods, I prefer food that taste sweet and not spicy such as desserts. Besides, I also like to eat bihun sup, ayam percik, chocolate 
cake and doughnut. These foods became my favourite food especially when my mother cooks it herself which it makes these food tastes 
more delicious rather than other people cook it. Furthermore, I like to eat bihun sup when the rainy weather because it gives
warmness as it has soup. For ayam percik, I really like to eat it especially during fasting month in Ramadan. Plus, I love 
to eat desserts such as chocolate, candy, ice cream or any desserts when I am in a good mood because it can boost my happy mode.
