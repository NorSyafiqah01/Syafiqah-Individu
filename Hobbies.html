<h1>Hobbies During Freetime</h1>


<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up" style="font-size:200px;color:blue;"></i>

<p><center><font color="purple"> <font size="5"> I have various hobbies such as shopping, watching Korean drama,
playing badminton, playing cats, traveling, taking pictures, playing bicycle and listening music.
By doing these hobbies, I can release my stress and it gives me a cheerful mode. I love shopping
with my family and friends on weekend because I also can hang out with them to enjoy. Plus, in
my free time, I will watch Korean drama or listening to music that can entertain myself. 
Furthermore, when travelling, I can take a look at the beautiful scenery and taking pictures as 
memory. It gives me a healing treatment and I can take a refreshing breath. Moreover, I like to 
play with my cats because it can overcome my lonely feeling as they are very clingy with me and 
they can become my companion when I play with them. In addition, I like to play bicycle and 
badminton as it can boost my energy and have fun with my friends. </font></p>
