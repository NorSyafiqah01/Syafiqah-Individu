<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;"> Life Motto </h1>

<div> My life motto includes ‘try and do something when there is an opportunity’, ‘don’t rush, enjoy the moment and 
take things slowly’, ‘when good chances come, don’t lose it’ and ‘only myself knows me better than other people’.  
These life motto gives me encouragement when I feel down, sad or when I want to give up on something. Furthermore, the
 encouragement words make me feel confident in everything that I do such as studying and when facing the people with 
variety of attitudes.  </div>
